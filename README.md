> Once `python test.py` passes:
>
> ```bash
> python app.py listings --full -n 6      # read the data (Milestone 1)
> python app.py fields                    # what you can filter on
> python app.py ask 'vintage graphic tee under $30'
> ```
>
> All three tools are stubs, so that last command will do nothing useful yet.
> That's the starting position.

     HOW TO USE THIS FILE

     This is your submission. Fill each section in as you finish the milestone
     it belongs to — don't leave it all to the end.

     Unit 3 asks for the first five sections. Unit 4 adds the five below them.
     Leave the unit 4 sections alone until then; they're here so you know
     what's coming.

     Everything is pasted as TEXT. No screenshots, no images, no video links.
     A typed block of output gets full credit; a picture of the same output
     gets none.

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 3 — THE BUILD ═══════════════════════ -->

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences: what a user asks for, and what they get back. -->



---

## Tool Inventory

<!-- Four lines per tool. This is worth 2 points and it's the single most
     common place students lose them.

     "Returns a list" earns NOTHING. The description has to say what is IN
     the list.

     The empty case isn't optional either — it's the thing your loop branches
     on, and if you don't decide it here you'll discover it as a crash in
     Milestone 5. -->

### `search_listings`

- **What it does:** Searches the 40 mock listings for items whose text matches the user's keywords, optionally narrowed by size and a price ceiling, and ranks them best match first. It does not call the model.
- **Inputs:** `description` (str) — keywords such as "vintage graphic tee"; `size` (str or None) — a size to match, None skips size filtering; `max_price` (float or None) — inclusive ceiling, None skips price filtering.
  - *Size match rule:* compare case-insensitively after deleting any parenthetical (so "XL (oversized)" becomes "XL"), splitting on `/` ("S/M" becomes "S" and "M"), and splitting on whitespace ("W30 L30" becomes "W30" and "L30"). A listing matches when the requested size equals one of those whole tokens. "M" matches "M", "S/M" and "M/L"; "S" matches "S" and "S/M" but never "US 9" or "XL"; "L" matches "L", "L/XL" and "W30 L30" but never "XL".
  - *Score:* the number of distinct lowercase words in `description` that appear as whole words in a listing's title, description, category, style_tags, colors and brand. Listings scoring 0 are dropped. Ties keep their order in the data file.
- **Returns:** A `list[dict]` of at most `config.SEARCH_RESULT_LIMIT` (10) listing dicts, highest score first. Each dict has `id` (str), `title` (str), `description` (str), `category` (str: tops, bottoms, outerwear, shoes or accessories), `style_tags` (list[str]), `size` (str), `condition` (str: excellent, good or fair), `price` (float), `colors` (list[str]), `brand` (str or None; None for most listings) and `platform` (str: depop, thredUp or poshmark). The dicts are the unmodified listing records.
- **When it has nothing:** Returns an empty list `[]` — never None, never an exception. This covers no keyword match, every match filtered out by size or price, and a blank `description`.

### `suggest_outfit`

- **What it does:** Asks the model for one or two outfits built around the thrifted item, naming pieces from the user's wardrobe when there are any.
- **Inputs:** `new_item` (dict) — one listing dict as returned by `search_listings`, using its `title`, `category`, `colors`, `style_tags` and `price`; `wardrobe` (dict) — has an `items` key holding a list[dict], each with `id`, `name`, `category`, `colors`, `style_tags` and `notes` (str or None). `items` may be an empty list.
- **Returns:** A non-empty `str` of plain text. With a populated wardrobe it describes one or two outfits that name specific wardrobe items by their `name`. With an empty wardrobe it gives general styling advice for the item and names no owned pieces.
- **When it has nothing:** An empty wardrobe is not a failure: it returns the general-advice string above, so the result is still non-empty. It never returns `""` or None and does not raise on an empty `items` list. If the model call fails, `generate.ModelUnavailable` is allowed to propagate and the loop handles it.

### `create_fit_card`

- **What it does:** Asks the model for a short social-media caption about the find, built from the outfit text and the item's details.
- **Inputs:** `outfit` (str) — the string returned by `suggest_outfit`; `new_item` (dict) — the same listing dict, using its `title`, `price` (float) and `platform` (str).
- **Returns:** A `str` of two to four sentences, written like a post rather than a product description. It mentions the item, its price and its platform once each, and is specific about the vibe. Different inputs, or repeated calls, give different wording, which depends on `config.CACHE_ENABLED` and `config.TEMPERATURE`.
- **When it has nothing:** If `outfit` is `""` or whitespace only, it makes no model call and returns the message `"No outfit to write a caption for — run suggest_outfit first."` (a non-empty str). It does not raise.

## Planning Loop

<!-- Your branch rule, stated as a rule — the condition AND both paths — plus
     the file and function that holds it.

     Like this:
       "If search_listings returns an empty list, put a message in the session
        and stop. Otherwise take the first result and go to suggest_outfit."
        — agent.py::run_agent

     The grader checks your code against what you claim here, so the file and
     function have to be real. -->

**Branch rule:** If `search_listings` returns an empty list, put a message in `session["error"]` that tells the user what to change (loosen the price, drop the size, or use fewer or different keywords), return the session, and do not call `suggest_outfit` or `create_fit_card`, so `outfit_suggestion` and `fit_card` stay None. Otherwise, put the first result in `session["selected_item"]` and go to `suggest_outfit`, then `create_fit_card` with its output.

**Where it lives:** `agent.py::run_agent`

**How the query is parsed:** <!-- regex, string splitting, or asking the model — say which -->

**What moves through the session:** <!-- which fields, in what order -->

---

## Sample Run

<!-- Two things go here.

     1. One FULL query and its output, pasted as text.
     2. Your three per-tool terminal tests — the command and what it printed. -->

**One full query**

```
$ python app.py ask '...'

```

**The three tools, tested one at a time**

```
$ python -c "from tools import search_listings; print(search_listings('graphic tee', max_price=30))"

```

```
$ python -c "from tools import suggest_outfit; ..."

```

```
$ python -c "from tools import create_fit_card; ..."

```

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. What you asked, what came back, what you changed.

     "I used Claude to help me code" is not enough.

     "I gave Claude my search_listings spec. It returned None on no match
     instead of an empty list, so I changed it" is the level we want. -->

**Moment 1**

- *What I asked for:*
- *What came back:*
- *What I changed:*

**Moment 2**

- *What I asked for:*
- *What came back:*
- *What I changed:*

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 4 — THE TEST ═══════════════════════

     Don't fill these in during unit 3.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Five criteria, five tries each, in this exact format.

     Five, because your criteria are written out of five. Mark each try PASS
     or FAIL, count the passes, and read that count against your target — a
     row targeting 4 of 5 with three PASS cells is MISSED (3/5).

     `python run_eval.py --label before` runs everything and writes the table
     into results/. Paste it here and fill in the verdicts. -->

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Real output from one try**, pasted as text, naming the file and function
that produced it:

## Verdicts and Diagnoses

<!-- MET or MISSED per criterion against LAST UNIT's target, plus a sentence on
     how you decided.

     Then, for every miss: which of the four places it happened — a tool, the
     loop's branch, the session, or the model's output — AND the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis:  "The fit card was bad."
     A diagnosis:      "The fit card criterion missed on 2 of 5 items. Both had
                        an empty brand field. My prompt puts the brand in the
                        first sentence, so the card opened with a blank and read
                        like a fragment. The tool worked; the prompt assumed a
                        field that isn't always there."

     Look for a pattern. Three misses on the same tool is one problem, not
     three. -->

| # | Criterion | Target | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |

**Diagnoses**

## Loop Trace

<!-- One full run, printed step by step, with the MCP call visible in it.

     `python app.py ask '...' --trace` once you've added the trace.step()
     calls in Milestone 2.

     Worth pasting BOTH the happy path and the empty-search path. The empty
     one should be visibly shorter, because it stops. If your two traces are
     the same length, your branch isn't working — and this is the fastest way
     anyone will ever find that out. -->

**Happy path**

```

```

**Empty search**

```

```

**On the MCP move:** <!-- what changed in your code, and whether anything
behaved differently afterwards. If the rewire didn't work, say exactly where it
broke — the error text and the last thing that worked. That earns the point in
full. -->



---

## The Improvement

<!-- What you changed, why your diagnosis pointed at it, and the after-run in
     the same table format. One change, measured properly.

     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

**What I changed:**

**Which failure it was meant to fix:**

### Run Log — After

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Did it help, and how do I know:**

<!-- If it made things worse, say that. Honestly reported, that earns full
     credit and is more interesting than one that worked. -->



---

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed: what you'd do, and why you stopped where
     you did. "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is
     left is not. -->
